<p>The 3rd Annual Pineapple GP is happening March 23rd 2019. This year our chosen charity is Jigsaw, a great organisation looking out for the mental health of young people in Ireland.</p>

<p>There’s a couple of ways to join in, we’ve made it super easy.</p>

<p>Drive to join in the on track action, donate any amount to automatically be in with a chance to <a href="https://bit.ly/2GlpcyO">win a Modello Dare Experience worth €400</a>. Either way, you are invited to the afterparty.</p>
