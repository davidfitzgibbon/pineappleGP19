<p>Last year was great fun so we’re doing it again, Pineapple GP 2019 is happening March 23rd 2019. Our chosen charity is Jigsaw, a wonderful organisation looking out for the mental health of young people in Ireland.</p>

<p>There’s a couple of ways to join in.</p>

<p>Choose DRIVE below to be part of the on-track action, or choose DONATE to give any amount and be in with a chance to <a href="https://bit.ly/2GlpcyO">win a Modello Dare Experience worth €400</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, you are invited to the afterparty.</p>
